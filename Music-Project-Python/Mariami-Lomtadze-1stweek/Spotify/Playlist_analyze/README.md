This code was inspired by ten things:

0. Using spotify's library it's possible to get the song's popularity. (scale : 0-100)
1. Soundtracks play a big role when I'm raiting a tv show. 

So, I wrote a code to see if there is any connecntion between tv show's rankings(my preference, although I have seen only first 4 : ( ) and the average popularity score of the tv-show's soundtracks playlists. 
Although, this code turned out more a recommendation to which tv shows watch next.

I was wondering if there is anyone who has seen all/most of these tv-shows and if so, how accurate is my results? Also, any suggestions about different ways to sort (by release date, length, etc.) are welcome. 

On the coding side: I used matplotlib library to visualize my data.
